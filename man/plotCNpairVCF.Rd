\arguments{
\item{binnedTable}{A segmented copy number matrix with bins per row and samples per column.}

\item{cnTable}{A raw copy number matrix with bins per row and samples per column.}

\item{pair}{A character vector with sample1 and sample2 IDs.}

\item{segmentTable}{A segment table generated by the breakclone::readAlleleSpecific or breakclone::readVCFCn functions. Also a list with a segment table of each type to plot both kind of data together.}

\item{breaks}{List of shared breakpoints per pair It will generate a tsv file per pair in outdir with shared breakpoints.}

\item{colors}{A character vector with colors for sample 1 and sample 2.}

\item{limits}{A numeric vector with y axis limits.}

\item{build}{The genome build of your copy number data. hg19 and hg38 work, other builds haven't been tested.}

\item{excludeChromosomes}{The name(s) of any chromosomes to be excluded.}

\item{fontLabelSize}{Number indicating size of the labels.}
