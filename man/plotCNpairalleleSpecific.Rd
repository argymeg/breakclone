}
\arguments{
\item{ASCATobj}{ASCATobj an ASCAT object (e.g. from ascat.aspcf)}

\item{segmentTable}{A segment table generated by the readAlleleSpecific or readVCFCn functions.}

\item{pair}{A character vector with sample1 and sample2 IDs.}

\item{breaks}{List of shared breakpoints per pair It will generate a tsv file per pair in outdir with shared breakpoints.}

\item{colors}{A character vector with colors for sample 1 and sample 2.}

\item{limits}{A numeric vector with y axis limits.}

\item{build}{The genome build of your copy number data. hg19 and hg38 work, other builds haven't been tested.}

\item{excludeChromosomes}{The name(s) of any chromosomes to be excluded.}

\item{fontLabelSize}{Number indicating size of the labels.}

\item{maxgap}{The maximum gap between two breakpoints for them to be considered concordant. If unspecified, it is automatically set to 5 times the average interprobe distance of the assay.}

\item{sharedBarSize}{Width of the shared breakpoints bars.}
